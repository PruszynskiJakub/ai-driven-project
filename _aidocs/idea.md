# Idea-to-Content Creation Platform

## Core Vision
An AI-powered creative workspace that transforms raw ideas into polished social media content through collaborative iteration between human creativity and AI assistance.

## Key Terms & Structure
- **Spark**: User captures their initial idea 
- **Story**: User elaborates with personal backstory, motivation, and context
- **Artifact**: The result created from story for a particular medium and format (stored as markdown)
- **Publication**: Composed of multiple artifacts for a specific platform/format

### Content Hierarchy
```
Spark (1)
├── Story (1)
├── Artifacts (many)
│   ├── Draft
│   └── Final
└── Publications (many)
    └── Composed of multiple Artifacts
```

## The Creative Journey

### 1. Foundation Creation
- **Spark**: User captures their initial idea 
- **Story**: User elaborates with personal backstory, motivation, and context
- **Foundation**: This rich context becomes the seed for all artifacts

### 2. Multi-Artifact Development
- **Artifact Types**: From one Story, create multiple artifacts (social posts, blog articles, images, videos, etc.)
- **Draft Creation**: AI generates initial draft for each artifact type based on Story (in markdown format)
- **Iterative Refinement**: User provides feedback, AI refines until Draft becomes Final
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple artifacts can be developed simultaneously from the same Story
- **Markdown Storage**: All text content stored and managed as markdown
- **Artifact Reuse**: Final artifacts can be source material for new artifacts

### 3. Publication Assembly  
- **Composition**: Combine multiple Final artifacts into platform-ready publications
- **Examples**: LinkedIn Post + Image = "LinkedIn Post with Image" publication
- **Flexible Reuse**: Same artifacts can be used in different publication combinations

### 4. Version Management & Snapshots
- **Linear Versioning**: Simple progression without branching complexity
- **Manual Snapshots**: User-triggered saves of complete Draft or Final states
- **Snapshot Navigation**: Return to previous saved states when needed

## Value Proposition
Bridges the gap between having great ideas and creating compelling social content by:
- Preserving the human creative spark while leveraging AI capabilities
- Providing structure to the often chaotic creative process  
- Enabling experimentation without fear of losing good versions
- Creating a collaborative space where human intuition guides AI precision
